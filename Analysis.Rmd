## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Overall rating


```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$rating[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$rating[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perception between the overall ratings of both brands.

### Comfort

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$comfort[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$comfort[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we suspect no difference in user perception of comfort.

### Exterior Styling

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$exteriorStyling[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$exteriorStyling[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we suspect no difference in user perception of exterior styling

### Interior

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$interior[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$interior[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is strong evidence to suspect that Hondas are perceived to have superior interior styling.

### Performance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$performance[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$performance[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perceived performance of both brands.

### Reliability

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$reliability[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$reliability[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perceived reliability of both brands.

### Value

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$value[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$value[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is strong evidence to suspect that Hondas are perceived to offer better value for money.

The scores in all categories seem to increase with model year. Checking the correlation between model year and each of the score categories, we get positive correlations, but the number seem low?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scoreCats = carsDotComReviews %>% 
  select(rating, 
         comfort, 
         exteriorStyling, 
         interior, 
         performance, 
         reliability, 
         value)

cor(carsDotComReviews$modelYear, scoreCats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

### Comparing Model Years

Looking at score categories over all reviews, Honda is ahead in every category but reliability. The difference is only significant the style categories and value for money. The pattern is similar for model years 13-14, but difference in value for money is no longer significant. For model years 17-18, Honda is ahead significantly in all categories except for reliability.

For model years 13-16, Toyota is rated significantly higher in reliability and performance, with other categores being fairly even. For model years 15-16, Toyota is also ahead significantly in the overall and comfort categories.

So Honda has been doing an excellent job marketing their cars in the last two years, however Toyota is consistently rated higher in the reliability category. Toyota should consider why Hondas are generally perceived more favourably the last two years, and continue to push their brand as the most reliable.
