## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Overall rating


```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$rating[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$rating[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perception between the overall ratings of both brands.

### Comfort

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$comfort[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$comfort[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we suspect no difference in user perception of comfort.

### Exterior Styling

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$exteriorStyling[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$exteriorStyling[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we suspect no difference in user perception of exterior styling

### Interior

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$interior[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$interior[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is strong evidence to suspect that Hondas are perceived to have superior interior styling.

### Performance

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$performance[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$performance[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perceived performance of both brands.

### Reliability

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$reliability[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$reliability[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we have no reason to suspect there is any difference in perceived reliability of both brands.

### Value

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t.test(carsDotComReviews$value[carsDotComReviews$make == "Honda"],
         carsDotComReviews$value[carsDotComReviews$make == "Toyota"],
         alternative = "two.sided")
```

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is strong evidence to suspect that Hondas are perceived to offer better value for money.

The scores in all categories seem to increase with model year. Checking the correlation between model year and each of the score categories, we get positive correlations, but the number seem low?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
scoreCats = carsDotComReviews %>% 
  select(rating, 
         comfort, 
         exteriorStyling, 
         interior, 
         performance, 
         reliability, 
         value)

cor(carsDotComReviews$modelYear, scoreCats, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
```

### Comparing Model Years

Looking at score categories over all reviews, Honda is ahead in every category but reliability. The difference is only significant the style categories and value for money. The pattern is similar for model years 13-14, but difference in value for money is no longer significant. For model years 17-18, Honda is ahead significantly in all categories except for reliability.

For model years 13-16, Toyota is rated significantly higher in reliability and performance, with other categores being fairly even. For model years 15-16, Toyota is also ahead significantly in the overall and comfort categories.

So Honda has been doing an excellent job marketing their cars in the last two years, however Toyota is consistently rated higher in the reliability category. Toyota should consider why Hondas are generally perceived more favourably the last two years, and continue to push their brand as the most reliable.

### Comparing Categories Across Model Years
There seems to be an upward trend in positive reviews. Some possible explainations would be that negative reviews become more likely over time. Perhaps reviewers write negative reviews when problems that take time to appear arrise, or having problems with the dealership. Perhaps buyers attitude towards their purchase is most positive just after buying, then decreases over time. Another explaination might be a greater proportion of fake positive reviews for more recent model years. If potential buyers are persuaded by user reviews, then it makes sense that the companies would have an incentive to flood the site with glowing reviews. This incentive would be strongest for the most recent model year. These relationships require further investigation.

The only exception to the upward trend is the reliability category.

### What Reviewers are Saying
The most common words used are "great" and "love". This is not surprising since the majority of reviews are positive

Restricting to when the reviewer does not recommend the car, we see the words "engine" and "noise" more commonly among Honda reviews. A potential problem with their cars? Restricting additionally to used cards, the word "vibration" now appears prominantly on the Honda side

Looking at recommended reviews for model year 2018, after removing the words "love", "great", "good", features", and "comfortable", the words "safety" and "reliable" becomes noticeably more prominant among Toyota reviews. If Toyota is marketing their cars as safe and reliable, then it looks like they are succeeding.
